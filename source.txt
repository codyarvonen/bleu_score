Trusting the Lord means moving forward even when the path is not completely clear.
The only downside to his job was that he had to go to war.
To me, the timing did not make sense, but I received a strong spiritual confirmation to trust in the Lord.
"Because of my father's call as a mission president, I received my own call to serve a mission earlier than the standard age for sister missionaries."
I am so glad I chose to trust in God and let Him prevail in my life.
Although that kind of permanent commitment felt a little scary, I knew it was right.
We want everyone to feel comfortable using the building as a resource to minister to others and bless their communities.
But we'll have to be a little bit flexible and understand through this time of transition how to record that in a way that still expects them to read and study the scriptures but is flexible enough to be reasonable for what we ask of them.
Feast upon the words of Christ; they will tell you all things what ye should do.
Being worthy to partake of the sacrament is a weightier and much more important matter.
Sometimes her patients got better, but sometimes they didn't.
He didn't respond that he would or he wouldn't.
Emma became deathly ill.
Joseph was constantly harassed.
What starts off as a simple hike in the mountains can easily turn into dangerous climbing, and even if no one gets injured, that one elder is going to be sore for days.
Thanks, I have waited a long time to be able to do that.
This proposal will be submitted for review.
Since we talked last have you had any experiences that have strengthened or weakened your faith?
Well, seems to me obedience is another form of respect—respecting the rules, respecting authority—so maybe respect should win.
The world was organized from existing elements, not created out of nothing.
The Creation occurred in six stages.
For instance, plants came in one, sea creatures and birds in another, animals and people in other stages.
The stages of the Creation took unspecified amounts of time.
Sometimes when hard things happen, we wonder if we can trust anyone, including God.
We fear He may disappoint us too.
The good news is that God loves us perfectly.
I felt that my Heavenly Father wanted this of me, and I had peace in doing it.
I am so glad I chose to trust in God and let Him prevail in my life.
I am certain that if I had relied on my own understanding, my life would not be nearly as rich in joy, happiness, and peace.
All right, now we started to talk about course requirements, and you mentioned assessments, but maybe let me just ask—is there anything else about assessments that we would say, any changes to assessments because of this?
May the Lord bless you to be wise and prudent and follow the counsel that you received in this presentation and as you teach one another, as I leave my testimony of the truthfulness of the things we've talked about today.
Yes, in the first place, God desires that we believe in Him.
Remember, David used just one small stone to take down a seemingly invincible giant
But he had four other stones at the ready
But doesn't God love us despite our shortcomings?
He loves us perfectly.
I think one thing that we learn from this story is we shouldn't get jealous about the gifts that other people give.
They felt like they made a really horrible mistake
And so, when they went there to get food, they actually met Joseph
Listen to inspiring music.
Talk about your feelings.
You can talk to them about how to help your friend have a great experience.
You also have the option to be involved in missionary lessons as much as you desire.

He led the way back to his store and told us to pick the best ham or piece of pork for ourselves.
Being rather bashful, I said we would rather he would give us some.
He really needs you to know that He loves you
Because He does
And we're happy to talk to you more, but if you really don't want us to, it's OK
I just needed you to know that."
She looked up at us with a much calmer expression
She said, "I guess you can come sit down."
Her name was Veronica
She opened up and told us about what was going on in her life
She was having a lot of family trouble and had gotten some bad news about her job
She had been feeling very lost and alone
sister missionaries and woman on park bench
We shared a scripture from the Book of Mormon with her and asked if she wanted to hear more about the gospel
She politely declined but thanked us for our message and for being so insistent about talking to her
Before leaving, we prayed with her on that small park bench, and we asked that she and her family would be blessed and guided
We never saw Veronica again, but that experience taught me that even though we might not see someone get baptized, just expressing love to someone is an important act of missionary work
Even the smallest actions can have a great impact, so when we receive a prompting—even if it seems a bit scary or we don't know why—it's important that we follow it
Because Heavenly Father knows what His children need
Even if the best we can do is to simply share the love of God with someone, that is still a success
Brief stories and testimonies of youth
It's Worth It

Illustrations by Michela Buttignol
I have seminary at 6 a.m., before school
I wake up really early to have time to eat breakfast, have family prayer, and walk to the church
But the more I go to seminary, the more I see that waking up early is worth it!
The teachers are really great and always teach with the Spirit
They are wise and know so much about the gospel, which made me excited to go and learn more
Going to seminary each morning helped me be brave enough to share the gospel with two classmates and helped me explain the scriptures
Seminary also helped me be brave enough to stand up for my beliefs
I was listening to the radio one morning, and a man was saying Joseph Smith was a liar
I was really frustrated by this because I had gained a strong testimony of Joseph Smith in seminary and knew that what the man was saying wasn't true
I told my seminary teacher about it, and he suggested I write a letter to the man and share my testimony of Joseph Smith
I wrote the letter and bore my testimony about Joseph Smith and the Church
It helped me calm down and not be so frustrated
He never responded, but I felt a confirmation of my testimony while I was writing
It made me really grateful that I had gained such a strong testimony of the Prophet and the gospel in seminary
Sunday School Service
young man and chairs
My parents have taught me that I should be an example for my friends because I hold the priesthood and because I represent Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ
It really helps me to choose the right and look for chances to serve others
I know that if I do good things, my friends will see what I do and maybe want to do good things too
After Sunday School a while ago, I was in the hall when I saw a teacher who needed help with some chairs
She was going to set them up outside the building for an activity
She didn't ask me to help her, but I saw that she needed help
There were a lot of chairs, and she was all alone
So I took most of the chairs outside and set them up for her
Afterward, the teacher said, "Thank you for helping."
It wasn't a big deal for me since it didn't take very long, but she was really grateful, which made me feel good
Later, the teacher told my mom about what I had done
My mom said I did a good thing and that I should keep looking for opportunities to serve others, because it's something that Christ would do
I was happy and grateful that I had served
It made me feel good, and it made me want to serve more often

The Gratitude Flashlight
When I entered high school, it seemed like everything became a lot harder for me
I was jealous of other people's talents, of people who seemed more cool than I was, of opportunities that came to others but not to me
I was always wishing for or wanting something I didn't have
I talked to my parents about it
They reminded me that Heavenly Father has already given me everything I need but that He may not give me every single thing I want
My parents helped me realize that when you understand that nothing you truly need is lacking, you can find peace
I recently read a book that compares gratitude to a flashlight
If you go outside at night where there aren't any lights, all you will see is darkness
But if you go outside with a flashlight and shine it on what's around you, you can see everything that is there
Gratitude is like that light
When it shines, it lights up what is already there
But because you can now see it, you appreciate it more
The great thing about the gratitude flashlight is that you can use it day or night, no matter where you are or what circumstances you're in
All you need to do is turn it on

Check out the progress from the last two weeks on the Salt Lake Temple renovation, with much of the work ongoing from previous updates
On the north and east sides of the temple, the work will continue through the end of the year to strengthen and consolidate the foundation walls and footings
Along North Temple Street, vertical shoring piles were previously installed
The lagging—which is made of large boards that fill the gap between the vertical columns—will continue being built up over the next few weeks in preparation for the extensive excavation work needed to accommodate lower floors of temple facilities
The secant wall is just being formed along the south temple foundations
A secant wall is a type of retaining wall that is made of reinforced piles of concrete that interlock
The purpose of the secant wall is to contain the foundations and soil under the foundations
The entire foundation system of the temple will be surrounded by secant walls
Take a look at the current south side of the temple with the large drilling rig used for the secant wall
The demolition debris has been significantly reduced as crews worked to remove and recycle as much of the debris as possible on the north side of the temple

Update an Existing Vendor
Use the Vendor Request module in FLS when a vendor's information needs to be updated
This sends a request to the Global Service Center (GSC) to make the changes in the Church Financial Information System (CFIS)
With FLS, it is no longer necessary to email these types of requests
The vendor information that typically needs to be updated includes an address change, a new government tax ID, a change in banking information, or a change in payment method
A Vendor Setup and Change form containing the desired changes and signed by the vendor must be attached to the request in FLS
CFIS automatically inactivates a vendor that has not been used for 24 months
An Add a Vendor request will need to be submitted in FLS to change the vendor's CFIS status back to Approved
TO UPDATE A VENDOR:
In the menu, click Finance , and then select Vendor Requests
Click NEW REQUEST , and select Update Vendor
Search for and select the existing vendor record
Click Advanced Search above the Vendor field
Enter the vendor's name, and click SEARCH
If too many results are returned, enter other information such as city, two-letter state code, or postal code to narrow the list
Modify or enter the vendor's current information for the required fields
Verify the payment method
It is strongly encouraged that all vendor payments be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT)
Approval to make payments by check for any new or existing vendor will be considered an exception and require special approval
Use the New Correspondence field to make the nature of the request clear and provide instructions to the Global Service Center (GSC)
For example, updating an address because the vendor moved locations is different from updating an address because the vendor opened a new, additional location
The Correspondence field also records requests for additional information and the responses provided
Currently, you must save the request before uploading a Vendor Setup and Change form
Double-click the plus icon to browse, and select the signed vendor form on your computer or drag and drop it onto the image viewer
Click ACTION and select Submit for Approval
The request to update a vendor will appear in your Vendor Request list with a status of Pending FM Approval
Please understand that the Vendor Request list only shows requests submitted by your FM group, but the Vendor Favorites module and the Payments module allow you to search across any approved vendor in CFIS
Vendor requests should be relatively infrequent
Consider following up with the facilities manager if the request seems to be delayed or unnoticed
After the Global Service Center has received and reviewed the required documentation, an approved vendor record is created in CFIS, and the status of your vendor request is set to Completed
You can then issue payments to this vendor through the Payments module in FLS
This topic is not yet translated into the language you selected
Please use the information currently available and check back for updates
If you need this topic translated for your work, click

Facilities managers establish relationships with vendors to provide goods and services to the Church
They should actively seek out qualified, professional, and reliable vendors that can provide multiple services or a variety of goods
Before considering adding a new vendor, facilities managers should determine if an existing vendor could provide the required goods or services
Potential conflicts of interest should be examined in the selection of a new vendor
Review the section on doing business with others in " Our Standards of Conduct " for more information on what to consider when selecting vendors
Watch this video to learn how to search for, add, or update vendor information:
In order for a vendor payment to be created through FLS the vendors must be approved, and their information must be recorded in the Church Financial Information System (CFIS)
This makes it possible for vendor payments to be generated centrally from Church headquarters
FLS allows those who are initiating payments to select any vendor with an approved record in CFIS
This is a significant advantage because vendors that an FM group wants to start using have often already been set up in CFIS
A global procedure for setting up new vendors and contractors has been established to provide management oversight to the process of engaging new vendors
FLS provides a new and standard method for submitting requests to add or update vendors
The Global Service Center (GSC) receives these requests and processes them in a timely manner
Correspondence with GSC related to these requests occurs in FLS and becomes part of the recorded request
The system ensures that two or more people participate in each request to set up an entity to receive payment from CFIS
The objective is to help protect employees from engaging in questionable behavior as well as safeguard the interests of the Church
After a vendor is approved and set up in CFIS, payments to that vendor can be initiated from FLS
The Global Service Center maintains a list of Vendor Setup and Change forms
The appropriate Vendor Setup and Change form for your area must be completed, signed by the vendor, and submitted as part of the vendor request in FLS
Depending on your area and country requirements, you may also need to obtain and submit additional documents
These could include taxpayer identification documents or proof of insurance
The Meetinghouse Facilities Department has been granted approval to implement a simplified procedure that only applies to the areas in the United States and Canada
For purposes of new vendor approval, facilities managers and project managers in these areas are being identified as Area Controller's Designees
As designees, facilities managers and project managers are responsible for reviewing the vendor setup documents obtained and submitted by an administrative assistant
If the documents are complete and the vendor should be approved, the facilities manager or project manager approves the request and submits it to the Global Service Center (GSC) for processing
The outline below indicates how each role fulfills its part in the process:
The Administrative Assistant:
Sends the Vendor Setup and Change form to the vendor (who completes the form and returns it to the administrative assistant)
Reviews the form returned by the vendor for completeness and, if necessary, works with the vendor to resolve any omissions or errors
Scans and uploads the reviewed PDF form to FLS
The Facilities Manager as Controller Designee:
Reviews the request in FLS to ensure that it is legitimate and that the form is properly completed
Performs any additional procedures needed to assess the proposed vendor's qualifications and any potential conflict-of-interest concerns
Approves or rejects the vendor request in FLS
Apply for Credit with Vendor
The process for setting up a vendor is unique to each area
Contact your local area finance staff to determine the process to follow to have a new vendor setup
Payment of all vendors by electronic funds transfer (EFT) is strongly encouraged
Approval to make a payment by check for any new or existing vendor will be considered an exception and will require special approval:
The FM first obtains written approval, via email, from the regional manager and area O&M manager
The MFD Financial Controller must then approve the exception
The Church utilizes payment terms that are considered 'standard trade terms' for each country in which it operates
Net 30 (meaning payment is due on or before 30 days following the invoice date) is considered the 'standard' trade terms for business conducted within the United States and Canada
Terms other than Net 30 can certainly be established between the Chu​​rch and a given vendor wherever there is justification (i.e. terms commonly used for that vendor's business/industry, discounts for early payment, pricing or service preferences, etc.)
Justified terms other than the 'standard' for a given country can be identified on the Vendor Setup and Change Form and coordinated through Global AP
TO APPLY FOR CREDIT WITH A VENDOR:
If it is necessary to apply for credit with a particular vendor, request a business credit application from them
Complete the vendor's business credit application using the FM group information
Do not disclose dollar volumes or other cost data
If the vendor needs credit references or has questions about incorporation issues, contact the manager of North American Cash Management, Treasury Services Division, 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-6135
For international offices contact your Area Administration Office
In the United States and Canada, the following steps are used to set up a new vendor
Obtain a copy of the Vendor Setup and Change Form
This form can be found in the MFD Resources Library
This form is required for all businesses in the United States
Send the following to the vendor:
Vendor Setup and Change Form
Vendor Relations letter
List of persons allowed to order goods and services and their dollar limits
List of persons allowed to accept delivery of goods and services
Ask for the Vendor's current general liability, workers' compensation, and auto liability insurance information
Evaluate what is provided to determine if the vendor is to be utilized
A copy of the Vendor Setup and Change Form should be kept for the AA to use when entering the vendor information into FLS
Approve a Vendor Request
The appropriate manager(s) must approve a request to add or update a vendor to CFIS before the request can be processed by the Global Service Center (GSC)
After an administrative assistant submits a vendor request, the request appears on the manager's Dashboard under Quick Links in the Vendor Maintenance section
Managers should get in the habit of reviewing their FLSDashboard and noticing if there are items in any of the Pending Approval categories
A vendor request that is pending approval can also be found on the Vendor Request list
When approving a vendor request, a manager confirms that the request is needed, the request is for a legitimate vendor, and the form is properly completed
The manager also examines whether doing business with this vendor could create a conflict of interest or other potential problem
The manager is responsible for helping ensure the Church obeys the laws of the land and adheres to fair business practices when selecting vendors
The Facilities Management group should also perform any additional procedures needed to assess the proposed vendor's qualifications
For example, in some areas vendors are required to provide a certificate of insurance
TO REVIEW AND APPROVE A VENDOR REQUEST:
On the Dashboard, expand the Approvals section in Quick Links and click Vendor Maintenance Pending Approval
Open the vendor request by clicking on the Request ID or by selecting View from the Actions icon
Review the vendor request details and the associated Vendor Setup and Change form
Confirm that the information in the request matches the form and that the vendor's information is correct
Pay specific attention to:
Tax and banking information
Confirm that the payment method is set to EFT
It is strongly encouraged that all payments to vendors are made through EFT
If the request includes paying the vendor by check, make sure that EFT is truly not possible before giving your approval
If you have not done so previously, determine whether use of this vendor will violate any conflict-of-interest standards
Verify that the vendor is qualified according to area and local requirements
As the local manager, evaluate whether the vendor is legitimately and professionally established and ethical in business conduct
Consider whether the vendor is competitive with price, terms, and quality
Confirm that purchases cannot be better satisfied by using an existing vendor
Where appropriate, partner with Purchasing or Accounts Payable to further validate the vendor
Click on ACTIONS , and select either Approve or Reject
Approve—Click Yes to confirm the approval
Reject—Enter the reason for rejecting the vendor request, and then click Submit
After the manager or managers have approved the vendor request, the status is changed to GSC Submitted
If the vendor request is rejected, it is returned to the administrative assistant
It can be modified and resubmitted for approval
This topic is unavailable in the language you selected
The information is intended for positions such as area office staff, where a translation is likely not needed
Before payments to a vendor can be issued from the Church Financial Information System (CFIS), the vendor must be properly set up in the system by the Global Service Center (GSC)
When preparing to request that a vendor be added to CFIS, make sure that the vendor does not already exist in the system
If you are unable to find the vendor, try searching on only part of the vendor's name
If you determine that the vendor is not in the system or has possibly been inactivated, contact the vendor and ask them to complete the Vendor Setup and Change form
After the Vendor Setup and Change form has been signed by the vendor, submit a request to add or reactivate the vendor using FLS
This action notifies Accounts Payable (AP) in the Global Service Center
Once your area is using FLS, the form is no longer submitted by email
Method 1: Use the advanced search option on the New Payment screen

Method 2: Use the search option on the Vendor Favorites screen
Click ADD FAVORITE
TO REQUEST THAT A NEW VENDOR BE ADDED TO CFIS:
Click NEW REQUEST , and select Add Vendor
Enter the required fields for the vendor
Use the New Correspondence field to make the nature of the request clear and provide instructions to Accounts Payable
This information was previously exchanged in emails
Currently, you must save the request before uploading a Vendor Setup and Change form and other documentation
Click ACTION , and select Submit for Approval
The request to add a new vendor will appear in your Vendor Request list with a status of Pending FM Approval
Respond to GSC Correspondence
Pay attention to the Quick Links section on your FLS Dashboard screen
Expand the Vendor Maintenance heading to see if there is a request returned from the Global Service Center (GSC) that needs your attention
If there is, you should see a change in the count next to GSC Returned
TO RESPOND TO THE GLOBAL SERVICE CENTER:
Find and click the GSC Returned category in Quick Links. This opens a filtered view of your vendor requests
Only requests with a status of GSC Returned will be displayed
Alternatively, you can use the Finance menu to go to Vendor Requests and then find the returned request in the full list

Scroll down to the Correspondence History field, and review the recent comments from GSC to determine what additional information is needed. Comments from GSC are labeled as Response Message
When you have the needed information, enter your response in the New Correspondence field
If an error in the Vendor Setup and Change form needs to be corrected, use the Replace button to upload a revised version signed by the vendor
Use the Attachments (paperclip) icon to upload any additional documents to FLS and associate them with the request
Click UPDATE to send the request back to GSC. After GSC has received and reviewed the required documentation, an approved vendor record is created in CFIS, and the status of your vendor request is set to Completed
People Management Principles 12-page Booklet
This will be a 12-page booklet with a First Presidency message, PMP overview, and the people management principles and applications
People Management Principles
Leadership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whether by Church calling or by employment, is not modeled after the leadership standards of the world
The ultimate leadership example worthy of emulation is that of the Lord Jesus Christ
He taught, "Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all" (Mark 10:42–44)
Those appointed to leadership positions serve those they lead
To serve effectively, leaders realize that authority in the Church is governed by principles of righteousness
Indeed, His kind of leadership comes naturally to only a few, but it can be developed (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:34–41)
Personal development and eternal progression are fundamental to our beliefs
As we appropriately apply this principle to Church employment, we come to realize that anyone who performs anything for the Lord must do so "with all [his or her] heart, might, mind and strength" (Doctrine and Covenants 4:2)
This requires leadership with a sacred responsibility to correct and build others while "showing forth afterwards an increase of love" (Doctrine and Covenants 121:43)
Patience and perseverance are part of our eternal progression
Learning to lead in this way will take time
Your constant effort, combined with all available resources, is needed
The quest to learn Christlike patterns of leadership is based on love for coworkers, an eye single to the glory of God, and a reliance on the Holy Ghost
The growth, well-being, and happiness of others become paramount
As you study and apply the four sections in People Management Principles, you will be inspired to improve your approach to the Lord's work
In harmony with the Leadership Pattern, these People Management Principles will help you become a better servant and a better leader
We pray that you will be richly blessed as you contribute even more to the building of the Lord's kingdom on earth
"This is a hinge point in the history of the Church
Things are going to move forward at an accelerated pace
We think the Church is an old Church
But it's only the beginning
—President Russell M. Nelson (Rome Italy Temple dedication, 2019)
In the Church workforce, no other role will have a greater influence on the "unprecedented future" President Nelson foresees than that of the people manager
Raising and clarifying the expectations of those that have people management responsibilities is vital as we look to the future
What are People Management Principles?
People Management Principles help us align on to what we believe when it comes to managing the Church workforce, including how we select, manage, develop, and reward employees
These principles and applications have been created through input from General Authorities and senior workforce leaders
The principles outline clear expectations for people managers as they work to successfully manage the Church workforce
Why do we need People Management Principles?
In the past, our approach to managing individuals and teams has varied by department or area
Questions such as "How do we recognize and reward high performance?"
"Do we place greater emphasis on external or internal candidates in our hiring practices?"
"How do we respond when performance expectations aren't met?" and "What is the role of a leader in building capability?" have been answered in different ways by different managers
This inconsistency may create poor employee experiences, decrease engagement, and ultimately reduce our ability to accomplish the work of the Lord
The clear expectations outlined in People Management Principles provide aligning guidance on how to make management decisions at the Church
Adherence to these principles will increase team and individual contribution and engagement, improve employee experience, and enable the Church workforce to more fully engage with prophetic priorities
In harmony with the Leadership Pattern, these principles will help us become better servants and better leaders
How do People Management Principles differ from the Leadership Pattern?
The Leadership Pattern provides a critical foundation for the Church workforce by defining general leadership behaviors that all employees are expected to follow
It helps each member of the workforce discover how to do the Lord's work in the Lord's way
People Management Principles provides more specific, aligning guidance and expectations for those with people management responsibilities
It is intended to help people managers know how to successfully manage, develop, and motivate their teams
How do I implement People Management Principles?
Successfully adopting these principles and applications will require effort
As you face challenging people management decisions, People Management Principles will be an invaluable asset
Familiarize yourself with the principles and applications in this booklet
Take time to review the available additional resources and training
As you apply these principles and counsel with your Human Resources representative about how to best apply them to your circumstances, you will become a more effective people manager
Please recognize that aligning with People Management Principles may require some changes in each of us
You may find it necessary to adapt your personal management philosophy or approach
But as every department and area of the Church integrates these principles into their management decisions, the rewards will bless the lives of employees, managers, and those they serve as we move toward the "unprecedented future" ahead
We will become more unified as we serve together in the cause of the Master
Recruitment and Selection
Partner with the Lord— The Lord prepares people to do His work (see Esther 4:14) and will guide our efforts to find qualified candidates
When making hiring decisions, seek the Lord's guidance as you do the necessary work to find those who are prepared to do His work
Seek the Best Candidates— The best candidates are devoted to building the kingdom of God (see 1 Samuel 16:7) , are highly skilled in their profession, and have potential to contribute beyond the current position being filled
Build Representative Teams— To meet the needs of the global Church, teams should be able to represent the diverse perspectives, broad life experiences, and backgrounds of Church membership (see 1 Corinthians 12:4, 14)
1. Proactively recruit prospective candidates for critical roles, with an eye to both current and future needs
Church recruiting staff are key partners to support you in this effort
2. Consider both internal and external options when seeking qualified candidates
As a general rule, promote transparency by posting jobs internally and externally whenever possible
Managed moves (transfers made without posting a position) should be limited and done judiciously to meet business needs
When there are two equally qualified individuals, give preference to the internal candidate
3. Recruit qualified applicants with diverse perspectives and broad life experiences and backgrounds
Then select the candidate most qualified to meet the needs of the Church
4. Use a qualified and diverse selection team to make hiring decisions
Make the interview process as consistent and fair as possible
Help candidates understand how the Church is similar to and distinct from other workplaces so they can determine whether Church employment is right for them
Help new employees adjust to their new roles and to the Church work environment by providing training, mentoring, and other support
Lead with Love— We seek to live and work so that we can accomplish the Lord's work in His way and with His power
A key aspect of working in the Lord's way is to lead with love (see Doctrine and Covenants 12:7–8)
Set High Expectations— The Lord has high expectations of our contribution in Church employment in both results and behavior (see Doctrine and Covenants 104:11–13; 107:99)
A critical role of managers is to model, inspire, enable, and expect meaningful contributions in terms of both accomplishing the work and exemplifying the Leadership Pattern
Seek the guidance of the Spirit to know how to help others increase their ability to make significant, strategically aligned contributions
Provide Candid Feedback— Feedback is essential to meet the Lord's high expectations for His work
Praise and suggestions given with a desire to help, as well as timely corrective feedback given in a spirit of love (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:43) , will enable teams to more fully understand and accomplish the work
Help individuals and teams give their best to the Lord by aligning with a clear vision, communicating expectations, providing support, and helping them resolve challenges
Measure your success by how well you have enabled and supported those you lead to contribute at a high level
2. Invite individuals to be accountable through stretch goals, measurable outcomes, and frequent conversations about progress
3. Create an environment where individuals feel safe seeking and sharing candid feedback
Encourage those you lead to invite and value feedback
Lead by example in actively seeking feedback from others and encouraging peer-to-peer feedback
4. Identify early the areas where improvement is needed
Be clear and honest about concerns, and provide ample opportunities for improvement
Give support and correction lovingly and patiently, but do not avoid difficult conversations
5. Do not allow poor performance to persist without resolution
Partner with the Human Resource Department early when an employee needs help
Options may include clarifying expectations and helping facilitate movement to a role more suited to the individual's abilities
However, do not move poor performers to other departments with the intent "to be rid of a problem."
At times and after sufficient efforts, sustained poor performance may necessitate initiating separation from Church employment
Document your efforts and results at every point
6. Recognize and celebrate high contribution for both collective and individual efforts (see "Compensation, Benefits, and Recognition" for additional details)
Strive for Continuous Improvement— Committing to continuously learn, both on our own and as an organization, is essential to keeping pace with the Lord as He hastens His work
We are expected to continuously improve and increase our contribution to the Lord's work (see Doctrine and Covenants 82:18)
Just as the Savior builds capability and confidence in those He leads, we are to actively encourage, develop, and coach those we lead (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:106; 108:7)
Foster Experience-Based Development— We follow the Lord's pattern for development by building people through His work (see Doctrine and Covenants 105:10)
We also provide opportunities for all to receive supplemental development through training, coaching, and mentoring
Help those you lead to continuously improve in their current role
Encourage and help them to prepare for future roles—whether within Church employment or with other organizations
2. Create a safe learning environment where individuals feel comfortable stretching and taking on challenging assignments
Provide support as needed to help maintain desired performance
When individuals make mistakes, help them learn from the experience
3. Cultivate global and broad-based awareness in the teams and individuals you lead
This will help meet the needs of the global Church
4. Provide development experiences that balance the needs of the organization with the development interests and needs of the individual
When you give a challenging experience-based assignment (e.g., task force, special project, rotational move, etc.), help the individual understand the desired learning objective and invite him or her to regularly report what he or she is learning
Offer coaching, encourage reflection, and invite the Spirit to guide and teach
5. Share with individuals the potential you see in them
Develop them for the future without creating unrealistic expectations
Prepare to meet the needs of the Church by identifying and developing successors for critical roles in the organization
Make this work a key priority
Invest more development resources in the highest performers with the greatest potential
Leaving an employee in the same position for too long can limit personal development and inhibit organizational effectiveness
Help those you lead to broaden their perspective of career development to include horizontal as well as vertical movement
Where possible, use cross-organizational experiences and rotation assignments to enrich development, increase engagement, and enable individuals to more fully contribute to the Lord's work
Compensation, Benefits, and Recognition
Compensate Fairly— We strive to compensate individuals fairly as they engage in this great work
Compensation and benefits should be viewed together as a total package
Compensation is generally designed to be comparable to that of similar jobs in the relevant market
The Church may be conservative with salaries in certain grades and roles
Recognize and Show Appreciation— We all seek to become "good and faithful" servants (Matthew 25:21)
Expressing appreciation to those we lead increases their ability to accomplish the Lord's work
We should appropriately recognize and celebrate team and individual contributions
Use Wisdom and Order— When we administer programs and make decisions about compensation and benefits, we should do so "in wisdom and order" (Mosiah 4:27)
We must balance individual employee expectations with our responsibility to wisely manage sacred Church funds (see Doctrine and Covenants 51:19)
Help those you lead understand that while many components of compensation, benefits, or well-being programs may be similar to what other organizations offer, working at the Church also includes many intangible benefits and blessings associated with its mission of building up the kingdom of God (see Doctrine and Covenants 104:59) and preparing for Christ's return
2. Reward and recognize employees based on their full contribution, including the results they achieve, the Leadership Pattern behaviors they exhibit, and their growth in implementing their development plan
3. As you have salary conversations, help employees look at compensation and benefits together as a package, including pay and employer contributions to health insurance and retirement plans
This will help them make more accurate comparisons to other organizations
Where possible, employees will have access to a Total Rewards statement, which will show the combined value of both their compensation and their benefits
When managing merit increases, remember that higher-performing employees should receive higher merit increases than lower-performing employees
It is appropriate for employees who are not meeting expectations to receive a lower salary increase
In some cases, based on performance, some may receive no salary increase
Performance being equal, give higher merit increase percentages to those who are paid lower in the salary range
5. Using provided resources and tools, help educate employees on the basic components of their compensation and benefits
6. In addition to merit increases, consider no-cost and low-cost forms of appreciation and recognition

Who was David Whitmer?
Study help for this week's Come, Follow Me readings
The Lord chose Three Witnesses who would see the Book of Mormon gold plates so they could "testify to the truth of the book and the things therein" ( 2 Nephi 27:12 )
One of these witnesses was David Whitmer
A Helping Hand
David heard about the gold plates from his friend Oliver Cowdery, who was acting as scribe as Joseph Smith translated
Oliver later wrote to David, asking if he and Joseph could stay with him and finish the translation
David traveled 300 miles (483 km) to Pennsylvania to bring Joseph and Oliver to his parents' home in New York
David's interest grew as he watched Joseph translate the Book of Mormon
Always a Witness
Along with Oliver Cowdery and Martin Harris, David was shown the plates by an angel and heard the voice of God command them to testify of what they had seen
Unfortunately, David left the Church a few years later and never returned, but he never denied his testimony
Near the end of his life, David wrote: "I have never at any time denied that testimony or any part thereof, which has so long since been published with [the Book of Mormon], as one of the three witnesses
Those who know me best, well know that I have always adhered to that testimony
And that no man may be misled or doubt my present views in regard to the same, I do again affirm the truth of all of my statements, as then made and published" ( An Address to All Believers in Christ [1887], 8–9)
We may not see the gold plates, but we can still be a witness
How can you be a witness and testify of gospel truths?

Stories and tips for strengthening marriage at any age
By Christy Monson
A few stories and tips for strengthening marriage at any age
Getting married later in life can involve some unique twists and turns
But as couples walk this path with faith, they can discover great joy and develop Christlike qualities
Here are three life lessons from those who found romance in their older years, followed by three tips for blending families
I hope that sharing this will help older newlyweds—or those still waiting for marriage—realize that they are not alone in their journey
These short principles can prompt ideas for strengthening any marriage, whether you've been together 50 years or 5 months
Keep an Eternal Perspective
Mona (names have been changed) didn't think she would ever find an eternal partner after two failed marriages
Then she moved to a retirement center and met Bob
They became friends, and she introduced him to the gospel
About the time they became engaged, Bob was diagnosed with cancer
He asked Mona if she still wanted to marry him
"Of course," she said
"I'm marrying you for eternity, not just for this life."
The couple married, and Bob was baptized
They were both in wheelchairs as they were sealed in the temple
Mona said there was a celestial light about Bob that day
He lived another six months, rejoicing in each day with his sweetheart
Now Mona can't wait until they are together again
When Cassie fell in love with Albert, she worried about falling into the same negative communication patterns she had seen in her first marriage
So they took a marriage class together, where they learned to:
Practice listening skills
Honestly share feelings
Cooperate, not compete
Agree to disagree when needed
Discuss money management
"Building a successful marriage takes practice, but we love each other enough to make it work," Cassie said
Navigate Changes with Love
Amanda puzzled over her patriarchal blessing
It said she would be a great influence on her children and grandchildren, but she was past childbearing years and had never married
Then she met Patrick, a pilot
They enjoyed listening to music and playing golf together
After a while, they got married
Although they grieved the loss of their mother, they eventually warmed to Amanda's love
One day, Patrick went flying and never returned
After weeks of searching, the plane was found in a nearby lake
Amanda realized that she was the only living parent Patrick's daughters had left
She made an extra effort to support and communicate with them, especially through their grief
Now she and her stepdaughters have a strong bond
They call her for advice and turn to her after a stressful day
With humility and gratitude, Amanda realizes that her patriarchal blessing is being fulfilled after all
Three Tips for Blending Families
Terry and Lucinda are both in their second marriages
Terry's stepson loves to golf, so they plan a golf date each week
Lucinda set up a special area with books, games, and puzzles for the grandkids when they visit
After Cassie and Albert married, Cassie's children refused to visit for Christmas
The couple decided to drop presents off anyway, give the grandkids a hug, and let everyone know they were welcome anytime
It wasn't long before the entire family grew to love Albert and started gathering for holidays
Try extra hard to connect
Amanda reads stories to her new grandchildren over the computer and even prepares easy science lessons for them
Another mom hosts an online chat once a month with family members scattered around the country
Loving those who come into our lives—like new spouses and children—may not be easy, but marriage and new families can replace loneliness with joy
As we ask Heavenly Father to bless us with charity, we can, at any age, grow more worthy to meet our Savior

It is hard to describe the amazing joy that filled my soul as I left the clinic that day
While sitting in a medical clinic waiting room, I noticed a mother with her daughter
The child wore a face mask and coughed many times
Her eyes were sunken, and her face was pale
I couldn't help but feel sorry for her
Her mother looked worn-out
The waiting room was small, so I heard everything she said
After she paid her co-pay for their visit, the receptionist reminded her of a past-due balance that was more than double what her current visit cost
The woman explained, with difficulty controlling her emotions, that she would not have any spare money until the following month
She said she barely had enough to pay her rent
The receptionist told her she should try to pay off her balance as quickly as possible
The woman and her child were then ushered into the back for their appointment
As I sat there, I couldn't stop thinking about the woman and her situation
I am by no means wealthy, but when I thought about how good the Lord has been to my family and me, I felt an overwhelming desire to help this woman and her daughter
I approached the receptionist, wondering if what I wanted to do was even possible
I explained that I had overheard the woman's predicament and wanted to pay her remaining balance
The receptionist was surprised but also delighted to honor my request
I asked her to tell the woman that the balance had been paid and that she no longer need worry about it
I also told the receptionist not to say who had paid it
Then I paid the balance and continued with my appointment
I did not see the woman or her daughter again, but I prayed that things would soon improve for them
No wonder the Savior speaks about having a fulness of joy (see Doctrine and Covenants 11:13 )
More than ever before, I knew that I wanted to be more like my Savior and to experience more often the joy that comes from serving Him
God Told Us to Be Baptized
An explanation of why baptism with the correct authority is important
Jesus Christ set an example of being baptized by someone with God's authority
While we don't have a lot of details about the personal life of Jesus Christ, we do know that He was baptized when He was about 30 years old (see Luke 3:23)
Here are some things we learn about baptism from His example
If we are old enough and mature enough to tell the difference between right and wrong, Heavenly Father wants us to be baptized (see Doctrine and Covenants 18:42 )
Jesus was perfect, but He still chose to be baptized to follow God's commandments (see Matthew 3:13–17 )
Even those who already died can accept baptism
We offer it to them by being baptized for them in temples
Done by Authority
Jesus didn't get baptized by just anyone
He specifically went to His cousin John, who had priesthood authority from God
After Jesus died and His disciples were killed, that priesthood authority was lost from the earth
Then, in 1829, John the Baptist appeared to Joseph Smith and gave him authority to baptize in God's name
Because of that restoration, we have the chance to be baptized with authority today
A Two-Way Promise
Baptism includes a two-way promise, or covenant, between us and God
To take upon ourselves the name of Christ
To keep His commandments
The words of the sacrament prayers remind us of this covenant each week
The Holy Ghost Is an Important Part of Baptism
The scriptures tell us that after Jesus was baptized, the Holy Ghost appeared in the form of a dove (see 2 Nephi 31:8 )
Today, after a person is baptized, they are confirmed
This means they receive a special blessing in which they are invited to receive the spiritually cleansing gift of the Holy Ghost (see 2 Nephi 31:17)
The Holy Ghost can warn us of danger, comfort us, guide us to make good decisions, and help us feel God's love (see Doctrine and Covenants 39:6 )
We Can Always Repent
God knew that we would make mistakes every day
Despite our best efforts, we would sin and fall short of living up to our baptism promises
So He gives each of us the chance to repent
Every day we can do our best to apologize and right any wrongs
We can pray and ask for God's forgiveness
Then, when we take the sacrament with a humble heart, our sins are forgiven as if we were baptized again
What Do Scriptures Say about Baptism?
Parents should help their children prepare for baptism (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:25 )
Those younger than eight years old don't need to be baptized (see Moroni 8 )
When we are baptized, we promise to "mourn with those that mourn; comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" ( Mosiah 18:9 )
Helps for Parents
If you are helping a child get ready to be baptized, see the article on page 22
We hope you've enjoyed learning about baptism
Here are other gospel words from this issue:

Upon You My Fellow Servants, by Michael Malm and Linda Curley Christensen
Ministering to Those Who Are Incarcerated
Ideas for how we can minister to those who are incarcerated
The worth of a person's soul is not diminished by crime
Right now, more than 10 million people are being held in jails or prisons worldwide. 1
Jesus Christ, who loves each person and understands every difficulty, asks us to minister to all of Heavenly Father's children—including those who are incarcerated
"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee in prison, and came unto thee?
"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" ( Matthew 25:37–40 )
How can we do what the Savior asks and safely minister to those who are incarcerated?
This article provides basic principles as a starting point
Prayerfully discuss with local Church leaders what is appropriate and wise for your area
Fellow Children of God
While justice systems differ, the challenge of incarceration is shared across nations and cultures
Doug Richens manages outreach for incarcerated members of the Church
He also coordinates with other faith and community groups to help those impacted by incarceration, regardless of their background or religious views
"A common stereotype of those who are incarcerated is that they are all untrustworthy, violent, and dangerous," Brother Richens said
"However, I've found that most are not like that
Most feel remorse for their actions
They are trying to rise above the bad choices of the past and live good lives."
In some countries, as many as half of all citizens have an immediate family member who has been incarcerated. 2
These incarcerated siblings, parents, and children are—apart from being defined by any earthly relationship—fellow children of God
Mortal and Eternal Judgment
Although life requires us to make judgments, Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are the only ones who can perfectly judge someone based on their situation, actions, and desires (see 1 Samuel 16:7 )
That perfect judgment will surely take into consideration circumstances people are born into that make incarceration more likely, such as family trauma, generational poverty, a culture of drug use, etc
Many other factors can influence a person's ability to make good choices, including their health and well-being. 3
While it's important for society to enforce laws that keep communities safe, we can do so with compassion and an eternal perspective, realizing there is much we don't understand
"Think about how you would feel if you were judged for the rest of your life based on the worst thing you had ever done," said Tanja Schaffer, a member of the Church who worked at a legal office before founding a prisoner-advocacy group
"It is up to God to forgive whom He will forgive, but He commands us to forgive everyone" (see Matthew 18:21–22 )
The principle of God's perfect judgment can also be a source of comfort for victims of crime
Victims may suffer long after the prison terms of perpetrators have ended
Many people impacted by incarceration have been both a victim and a perpetrator at different times, reminding us that life is a complicated web of relationships and decisions that affect others
We can find comfort in trusting that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ understand it all
Their judgment will be perfect
The healing They offer—for both the innocent and repentant—will be complete (see Revelation 21:4 )
The Loving Example of Leaders
Elder Gerrit W. Gong of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles described a meeting where everyone around him was dressed in white
There was singing and praying, and God's love was abundant. 4
Contrary to what many of us might be picturing, this wasn't a temple meeting
This was a ministering visit at a prison where white jumpsuits were the standard uniform
"The leaders of the Church care about all who have been impacted by crime and incarceration," Brother Richens testified, describing how one leader gives his own copy of a Church magazine to someone he visits in prison each month
"They frequently visit the incarcerated, support their families, and tenderly care for victims."
Correctional ministries are the responsibility of the stake president, working with ward leaders to address the needs of those in their area
What are your stake leaders doing to minister to and share uplifting messages with incarcerated members?
In some places, Church members may be called to visit and teach incarcerated people
Brother Richens said that often those members called to provide support are nervous at first, but then they find the calling so meaningful that they never want to be released
While we shouldn't feel pressured to visit incarcerated people we don't know, there are other ways we can safely minister
Here are a few:
Include incarcerated people in your prayers, especially any you know by name
Prayer is powerful!
Check with local prisons or jails to see if they need donated items
Reading, crafts like crocheting, art projects, and family history research are allowed in many facilities
If you know someone who is incarcerated, consider writing them uplifting letters
Make safe, wise choices while communicating
Follow the Spirit and maintain appropriate boundaries
Treat the family members of those who are incarcerated—especially children—with love, respect, and inclusion
Remember that family members are generally innocent victims too
The Holy Ghost can help us know how best to minister to all members of the family
The Holy Ghost Is Not Limited
Incarceration can be an incredibly difficult time in a person's life
But the Holy Ghost isn't limited by walls, bars, or chains
Prayer, scripture study, and humility can invite His comforting presence just as quickly within a jail cell as outside of one
Because of this, prison can become a place of miracles
Portia Louder, a member of the Church who wrote blog posts while incarcerated, described it as a difficult journey of faith and self-discovery
"I've been through some pretty serious struggles in my life, but I can feel myself being healed through a love that is indescribable," she wrote from prison
"Whatever challenge you are facing right now, wherever you're at on your own journey, please don't give up!"
Garff Cannon, who served as branch president in a jail, described how the Spirit prompted him to speak kindly to a hard-hearted incarcerated man who had led a difficult life
"What you just said to me were the kindest words ever spoken to me in my life," this man said
"I don't recall ever being spoken to with kindness and caring
They ended their visit with the first prayer this man had heard in years
"Yes, the Holy Ghost is definitely in the correctional facilities," Brother Cannon testified
"God's children are there, and He wants them back."
God makes powerful promises to all who choose to follow Him, whether we first learn about Him in Sunday School or in a prison
As Ezekiel 36:26 says, "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you."
The worth of a person's soul is not diminished by crime (see Doctrine and Covenants 18:10 )
When someone desires to change for the better, do we allow them to grow and be forgiven?
"God's grace and compassion are tremendous," Brother Richens said
"Sometimes incarcerated individuals feel forgiven by the Lord long before they are forgiven by the government, society, or even some members of the Church."
Returning to society after incarceration is difficult
Those who have been incarcerated often have trouble getting jobs or housing
We can help them find security in wholesome places and pursue healthy hobbies
Perhaps the most important thing we can do is to be a positive, strengthening friend
When Joseph Smith spoke about prison reform while running for president of the United States, he taught that "rigor and seclusion will never do as much to reform the propensities of men as reason and friendship." 5
Compassion Makes a Difference
Jude encouraged the Saints to "have compassion" ( Jude 1:22 )
His words echo the Savior's plea to remember those who are in prison
How will we respond to these invitations?
Let's make an effort to nourish those who experience incarceration—and their families—with the goodness of God
Our compassion can make a difference

Your Worth Is Great
Tips for parents on using this issue to teach children
God loves us and values us more than we can imagine
The Church magazines this month give a variety of articles and activities that can help you teach your children about repentance, baptism, the restoration of the priesthood, and that their soul is of great worth both to you and to their Heavenly Father
Hear Him and See Worth
Show the image and quote from the Savior on page 2
As a family, think of examples from the scriptures when the Savior saw the worth of one person's soul
On pages 32 and 36, you can find modern examples of how the Lord feels about those whom society sees as less valuable
Share how the Savior has helped you see your own worth or the worth of someone else
Showing Others You Value Them
One way to help others feel valued is to serve them
Study Brother Jan E. Newman's article on page 16, looking for his invitations to you
Prayerfully discuss as a family whom you feel inspired to serve
Make plans on how and when you will reach out in love to the person
Or after reading about incarceration on page 32, talk about how you might use the ideas in the article to help those who are incarcerated or how you might offer support, love, and friendship to their families
Preparing Children for Baptism
You can use this issue to help prepare your children for their baptism
"Helping Children Prepare for Baptism" on page 22 provides ideas for parents
You can find answers to common questions about baptism in "Gospel Basics" on page 6
You will find more ideas in this month's Friend magazine
See page 26 for supporting material for your weekly Come, Follow Me study
Circle of Worth
Doctrine and Covenants 10–19
Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer were counseled to remember that "the worth of souls is great in the sight of God" ( Doctrine and Covenants 18:10 )
As we help others to see their own worth, we bring them nearer to Christ while becoming closer to Him ourselves
Invite family members to sit in a circle
Each person will take a turn standing in the middle of the circle
Everyone sitting in the circle will tell the middle person, "You matter to me because ___________," and share specific details of why that person is of worth to them
The middle person will then choose their own statement of personal worth: "I matter to God and myself because __________."
Discussion: Why is it important to remember our own worth as well as the worth of those around us?
If Christ were in the circle, what would He say about us?
Read Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–13 and discuss what Christ went through because of how much He values us

Finding a Testimony
A Message of Hope for Those Who Are Incarcerated
Words of encouragement and hope for those who are incarcerated
By Douglas G. Richens
Church Manager of Prison Ministry
God's light can be a part of your future
Years ago, I was visiting a prison when I met a man named Eric
He had been incarcerated for 17 years
During this time, Eric rarely missed church
He prayed often with others and helped many people learn about the scriptures
When I met Eric, he was suffering from serious health challenges
I was able to visit with him in his prison hospital room
As we talked, Eric told me how grateful he was for the many Church members who had supported him over the years
He shared his testimony and faith in Jesus Christ
Then, in a whispered voice, he said there were still many days when he felt forgotten and alone
We talked for a while longer, prayed together, and parted as friends
A few hours later, I learned that Eric had passed away
Eric's journey through life had been rough
But he had eventually come to know and love Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and himself
And that is what matters
In the eternities, I don't think it will matter where or how we came to know Jesus
What will matter is what each of us did with our life after we found Him
The circumstances and choices that led to your incarceration do not need to define your life
You may have made mistakes, large and small
You may have committed a crime once or many times
This is part of your past, but your past does not decide your future
You have the power to make choices that will invite happiness, even during difficult times
Your True Identity
Sister Joy D. Jones, Primary General President, has visited prisons several times
She once told me this story:
"I remember the first time I visited the prison near where I live
As I spoke with a group of inmates, it felt like I was in a holy space because I knew they earnestly wanted to change and come to Christ
We talked about our divine identity as children of God
"At one point, I told them about my two-year-old granddaughter who came to me one day, smiling
She enthusiastically announced, 'Grandma, I'm a child of God!'
Then one person quietly said, 'I wonder what my life would be like today if someone had told me when I was young that I was a child of God.'
"The good news is that we are all God's children," Sister Jones continued, "whether we learn it as a child or later in life
It is never too late
His Son, Jesus Christ, is our Savior
He atoned for each and every one of us
Because of that, Jesus understands our lives perfectly, and we can be completely forgiven of our sins
He said, 'Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee
Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me' ( 1 Nephi 21:15–16 )."
Believing that you, and everyone you know, is a child of God can be a source of inner strength
As you accept this truth and let it guide your life, you will find greater peace and become an example of good for others
Throughout life it can be difficult to know whom to trust, but you can always trust your Heavenly Father
The scriptures teach that God knows you perfectly
He loves you and cannot lie. 1
If trusting others—including God—is difficult for you, pray about it
Ask your Heavenly Father, "Do You love me?
Can I trust You?"
Then listen for an answer
It may come as a peaceful feeling or calm thought
It may take time
But God will answer your prayers
In addition to knowing whom you can trust, it is important to become someone who can be trusted
It may not be appropriate for you to have contact with those you have harmed
But you can still consider past events from their point of view, develop compassion for them, and pray for them
You can choose to be a trustworthy person in the new relationships you form
It can be a long road
I'm grateful for this encouragement from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: "Keep loving
Heaven is cheering you on today, tomorrow, and forever." 2
You may be tempted to think that you can't be a parent during your season of incarceration
Resist this thinking
Whenever possible, find ways to support your family and children
In recent years, Church leaders have emphasized how important it is to teach the gospel to one another in our families
Ask yourself, "How can I help my family receive the blessings of the gospel?"
Here are four ideas:
You can always pray for your family
Prayer is a powerful type of spiritual work that is not limited by walls or distance
If you are allowed to communicate with your children, find appropriate ways to express your love
Teach them about the spiritual lessons you are learning
Make an effort to reconnect with trustworthy friends
Build relationships with those who would be a good influence on your family
Change for the better
Every effort you make to improve yourself and take responsibility for your choices will help you be a better father or mother
"And we do that as we repent daily and receive His cleansing, healing, and strengthening power," he taught
"Then we can feel enduring peace and joy, even during turbulent times." 3
Repentance is an important part of healing
It starts as you sincerely pray to God, telling Him what you have done wrong and asking for His forgiveness
You will begin to feel at peace as you learn more about the gospel and follow the example of Jesus Christ
These feelings, and your changing behavior, are evidence that you are beginning to heal
Church leaders are there to help you walk this path back to God
Through Jesus Christ, it will always be possible to return to your Heavenly Father
Although you may feel forgiven by God long before you are forgiven by family, society, or even some members of the Church, don't despair
Just continue to move forward
Trust God's promises and His timing
God Will Help You Heal
Remember that any sort of healing—including from addiction, abuse, or other trauma—takes time
The Bible tells the story of Jesus healing a blind man whose vision returned in stages
He first saw "men as trees, walking."
Then Jesus "put his hands again upon his eyes," and that was when the man finally saw everything clearly ( Mark 8:24–25 )
Similarly, when Jesus healed a woman who had an issue of blood, it was after she had suffered with a health problem for 12 years (see Mark 5:25–34 )
These stories remind us that physical, spiritual, and mental healing often happen over time
If you feel like your healing isn't happening as quickly as you'd like, try to identify small successes
Pray and talk to God about your feelings, including thanking Him for whatever progress you do notice
Whether you are already a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, learning more about the gospel, or returning to Church membership, please know that we care about you
No matter what your past has been like or how long the road is ahead, your future can be filled with God's light
The gospel path gives us strength
